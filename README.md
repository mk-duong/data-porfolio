# Data Porfolio

## â€ŽðŸ’¡ DDE Project Development
**Files:** [DDE Project Development](https://github.com/mk-duong/data-porfolio/tree/main/DDE%20Project%20Development)

**Goal:** Create an interactive dashboard visualizing a software project's development progress and analyze the working performance of team members

**Description:** The dataset includes development statuses for a variety of software packages and the task assignment for each memeber. This is one of the visualization projects I did when working the current company and has been granted permission to share it publicly.

**Techstack:** 
- Data transformation: SQL (Joins, Aggregate Functions, CTEs, Windows Functions, CASE statements)
- Data visualization: Power BI
  - Power Query: Data modelling (star schema)
  - DAX: Create measures and custom dimensions

**Gain:** Experience with SQL in BigQuery, and in-depth data modelling and visualization skills in Power BI

  
## â€ŽðŸ’¡ Netflix Data Analysis
**Code:** [Netflix Data Analysis](https://github.com/mk-duong/data-porfolio/blob/main/Netfix%20Data%20Analysis/netflix_data_analysis.ipynb.ipynb)

**Goal:** Answer questions relating to Netflix contents distribution as well as identify potential categories that can be included on the streaming services to target more audience

**Description:** Kaggle's [Netflix Movies and TV Shows](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows) dataset contains a list of movies and shows from Netflix along with details such as cast, directors, ratings, release year, duration, etc.

**Gain:** Data exploration and visualization with Python

# Data Porfolio

## â€ŽðŸ’¡ Ticketmaster ETL Pipeline
**Files:** 

**Goal:** Create a dashboard helping users to see what events are available near them

**Description:** A starter data pipeline project with Python, SQL Server, and Power BI. This project demonstrates my understading on ETL/ELT frameworks and how to design a simple data flow by using Ticketmaster API to extract events data from Ticketmaster with Python. Since data is fetched as a nested JSON file, it is flattended and pre-processed using Python before being loaded into Azure SQL Database for further transformation. Finally, Power BI is used to visualize event information.

**Techstack:** 
- Data ingestion: Python
- Data transformation: Python, SQL
- Data modelling: SQL
- Data visualization: Power BI

**Gain:**
- Become familiar in working with API
- Enhance exposure to Python coding and data modelling practices
