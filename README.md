# Data Porfolio

## â€ŽðŸ’¡ DDE Project Development
**Files:** [DDE Project Development](https://github.com/mk-duong/data-porfolio/tree/main/DDE%20Project%20Development)

**Goal:** Create an interactive dashboard visualizing a software project's development progress and analyze the working performance of team members

**Description:** The dataset includes development statuses for a variety of software packages and the task assignment for each memeber. This is one of the visualization projects I did when working the current company and has been granted permission to share it publicly.

**Techstack:** 
- Data transformation: SQL (Joins, Aggregate Functions, CTEs, Windows Functions, CASE statements)
- Data visualization: Power BI
  - Power Query: Data modelling (star schema)
  - DAX: Create measures and custom dimensions

**Gain:** 
- Experience with SQL in BigQuery
- In-depth data modelling and visualization skills in Power BI

  
## â€ŽðŸ’¡ Netflix Data Analysis
**Code:** [Netflix Data Analysis](https://github.com/mk-duong/data-porfolio/blob/main/Netfix%20Data%20Analysis/netflix_data_analysis.ipynb)

**Goal:** Answer questions relating to Netflix contents distribution as well as identify potential categories that can be included on the streaming services to target more audience

**Description:** Kaggle's [Netflix Movies and TV Shows](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows) dataset contains a list of movies and shows from Netflix along with details such as cast, directors, ratings, release year, duration, etc.

**Techstack:** Python
- Data cleaning & pre-processing: Pandas, Numpy
- Data analysis & visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

**Gain:** Data exploration and visualization skill with Python

## â€ŽðŸ’¡ Ticketmaster ETL Pipeline
**Files:** [Ticketmaster ETL Pipeline](https://github.com/mk-duong/data-porfolio/tree/main/Ticketmaster%20ETL%20Pipeline)

**Goal:** Create a simple data pipeline to build a dashboard allowing users see what events are available near them

**Description:** A starter ETL project with Python, SQL Server, and Power BI to demonstrates my understading on ETL/ELT frameworks and how to design a simple data flow. Data is fetched from Ticketmaster using Ticketmaster API and Python before being loaded into Azure SQL Database for further transformation. Finally, Power BI is used to visualize events information.

**Techstack:** 
- Data ingestion: Python
- Data transformation: Python, SQL
- Data modelling: SQL
- Data visualization: Power BI
